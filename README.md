-   **Centered Message Layout**: Focuses the message and a carousel of smaller, rotating photos in the center, with smoothly moving background photos. Ideal for a central focus. Requires 1-5 main photos and 1-10 background photos.
-   **Split Screen Layout**: Dividess the screen horizontally to display photos on one side and the message on the other, creating a dynamic and modern interaction. Requires 1-10 main photos and 1-10 background photos.
-   **Vertical Timeline Layout**: Organizes photos and message snippets in a vertical timeline, perfect for sequential narratives or progressive stories. Requires 1-20 main photos (tied to sentences) and 1-10 background photos.
-   **Photo Grid Message Layout**: Presents a dynamic grid of photos that animate, with the message integrated or highlighted below the grid. Great for showcasing multiple moments. Requires 3-9 main photos and 1-10 background photos.
